<p>Some of my hobbies are playing chess, swimming and coding</p><br></br>
<h2><i>About Chess</i></h2><br></br>
<p>I have 1500 Elo. Elo represents how good you are, the higher elo the better you are. Chess is an abstract strategy game played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. Chess is a turn-based strategy game with no hidden information and no elements of chance. White moves first, followed by Black. I play on chess.com which is linked under "Chess".</p><br></br>
<h3>About Swimming</h3><br></br>
<p>100m in an average pool it represented as going forward touching the wall and going back 4 times (touching the wall 4 times). I can swim 100m freestyle in 1:06 which uses all parts of your body like chest, legs and arms and it is done on your stomach. 200m breaststroke in 2:23 is a stroke where you kick your legs like you're making a circle. 100m butterfly in 1:30 is where you swing your arms above you like and eagle and while keeping your legs together you kcik the water with your shins. and 100 backstroke in 50 seconds, backstroke is done on your back and is basically backwards freestyle.</p><br></br>
